Team 15 - Li Ruochen, Liu Yangming, Shao Yufei, Xiao Tianle, Yu Jiaxiang, Zhang Jingyuan

Our project proposes a product that aims to address the issue of detecting misleading information related to COVID-19 for the pioneer generation. The COVID pandemic and its consequences have been actively discussed on social media. Several issues have been aroused concerning the pioneer generation.

Firstly, many of the pioneer Singaporeans may be more used to their mother tongue and may not be used to English, thus the common single English fact-checking tools are not useful.

Secondly, information from these non-traditional sources is often inaccurate and difficult to verify, and their rapid dissemination could exacerbate the negative impact of the pandemic.

The pioneer generation needs more explanation rather than just a single "valid" or "invalid" result. Therefore, we propose to develop a bilingual fact-checking tool by exploring various Machine Learning and Deep learning methods including Gradient Boost, BERT, CNN, and more. We also made our models results easy to be interpreted by the elderly.
